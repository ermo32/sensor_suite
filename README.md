# sensor_suite_esp
This project contains an ESP8266 WiFi SOIC. This SOIC is used as a controller to read multiple sensors and forward 
the aquisition results to the ThingSpeak network.

At startup this ESP8266 act as an Access Point (AP) so the user can set the network properties and after
reboot/restart the ESP8266 connects automatically to the WiFi network.
